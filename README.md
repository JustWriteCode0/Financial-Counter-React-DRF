Money counter was created for practice with django rest framework and react

stack: react, django rest framework, material ui

This project is not fully completed, but my goal to understand everything I need is achieved

During the development of this project, I learned how to work with react and material UI, as well as how to use the django rest framework.

I can add postgresql, set up docker and add redux, but all of that doesn't make sense because my goal was to learn react and DRF


if you want to start this project you should install all dependenses for npm and for DRF
